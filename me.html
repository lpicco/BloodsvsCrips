    <h2>How the violence started</h2>
    <p>The rivalry sates back to the 1960’s when Washington and Williams targeted Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens. After the attack both Scott and Owens setup their own gangs which formed the Piru Street Boys, this would be the first known Blood gang. The gang was initially setup as a way to provide protection against the Crips, and the more people that felt victimized by the Crips would join the Piru Street Boys, which would eventually become The Bloods in the early part of the 1970’s. The 1970’s was a prominent year on the calendar when the violence between the two gangs would escalate. The majority of gang related murders in that decade would be put down to Bloods and Crips.<p>
